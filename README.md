# The Bell Tower Beacon

The Bell Tower Beacon is an educational game that teaches the player about some of the resources available to the students at Brooklyn College.

## Game Play

The game has two components:
1. An exploration-based game where the player learns about the various resources available, through exploration of the map of Brooklyn College and through tasks that prompt the user to go to specific locations.
2. A Final Exam to test the player on what they learned from the game.

To add some challenge to the game there is a time element of how long it took to complete the tasks, (note some incorrect actions have time penalties) in the exploration part of the game. And a score for the Final Exam part of the game.

The two parts of the game can be played independently or as a whole game.
